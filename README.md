# Doxygen-Bootstrap
This is a small project for integrating Doxygen output with Twitter Bootstrap.

See the Stratify Documentation for an example:  https://stratifylabs.co/StratifyAPI/html/

The header.html and footer.html files in this repo are designed to be used with Jekyll and Github pages (specifically it is based on https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap/).  Be sure to modify the header/footer html files so that they fit your needs.  You can look at the source of https://stratifylabs.co/StratifyAPI/html/ to see what css and js files are used in the header.
